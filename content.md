# About me

I am a labrador Friend working at "Labrador labs inc.". I am an expert in sticks and I really good at walking around and finding nice sticks. My main research interest is the methods of finding the best sticks by their smell and the optimization of stick size during the walk. I am happy to discuss sticks, food and belly rubs with anyone interested. Trying [to make a link](https://google.com).
